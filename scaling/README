So: we have a lot of modules here. What are they for?

scaling-common contains the actual task to be performed; it's a simple
"calculate the prime factors of N" task, where N is a BigInteger.

scaling-cmdline is a simple driver that uses a standard ThreadPoolExecutor
to run a series of calculation tasks, with three thread pools:

* one thread
* two threads
* four threads

The performance will top out with the number of cores. Thus, if you have
a single-core machine, you'll see roughly the same performance out of all
three; a dual-core machine will run roughly twice as quickly on two cores 
compared to one, but the four-thread version will be roughly the same, etc.

The scaling datagrid provides a gigaspaces stateful space.
